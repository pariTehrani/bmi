                BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method for weight category: underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and
                obesity.
            </p>
            <p>
                BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat.
                Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcome as are these
                more
                direct measures of body fatness.
            </p>
            <p>
                BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. To determine
                if BMI
                is a health risk, a healthcare provider performs further assessments. Such assessments include skinfold
                thickness
                measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, and family history
